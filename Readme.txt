Handwritten Digit Recognition

The Python code implements a custom neural network framework for training models on the MNIST dataset. It includes various layers such as linear, sigmoid, tanh, softmax, and cross-entropy loss layers, organized using a `Sequential` class for sequential computation of forward and backward passes. Each layer handles specific operations like activation functions and loss calculations. The training process involves iterating over predefined hyperparameter configurations, performing forward propagation for predictions and loss calculation, and backward propagation to update weights and biases using gradient descent. The framework supports early stopping based on validation loss and evaluates model performance on a test set, visualizing training and validation loss curves. Models' weights can be saved and loaded for reuse, offering a foundational approach to building and training neural networks with basic machine learning and deep learning principles.
